## XGBoost from Scratch in C# Built by an LLM

XGBoost is a powerful, efficient implementation of gradient boosting, often used for classification and regression tasks due to its speed and accuracy. This version of XGBoost was built from scratch with the assistance of ChatGPT, and it was incredibly easy! It can be used in the same way as other regression algorithms, such as [Gaussian Process Regression](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2023/09/14/Gaussian-Process-Regression.aspx), [Kernel Ridge Regression](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2023/08/15/kernel-ridge-regression.aspx), [Neural Network Regression](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/Articles/2023/10/18/neural-network-regression.aspx), and more, making it a versatile tool for predictive modeling. The accuracy in practice was quite good. The main intention was to use XGBoost as one of many regression algorithms in an ensemble to make better predictions, which seems to work.
